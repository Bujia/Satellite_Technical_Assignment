### Background Info

- Data/logs are stored in `1HzLog` and updated every second.
- Each log record has a timestamp, indicating when the log was generated.
- Each log entry size is 5 KBytes, allowing up to one week of data to be stored in `1HzLog`.
- After one week, the Write Pointer (WP) begins overwriting old logs in a circular fashion.
- **Task**: Retrieve the log data for a specific 10-minute interval of interest.
- The satellite communicates with the ground system during a "pass," which lasts 600 seconds.

**APIs provided:**
1. `read_log(begin_address, length)`: Reads memory starting at the specified address for the specified length. 
   - **Time cost**: 1 second + 60 seconds per megabyte of data retrieved.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `begin_address`: The starting memory address for the read.
     - `length`: Number of bytes to read.
2. `get_wp()`: Retrieves the current Write Pointer (WP), indicating where the satellite is currently writing logs.
   - **Time cost**: 1 second.

### Problem Statement

The satellite logs data in a circular memory buffer, overwriting old data after one week. 
Given a specific time interval of interest, we need to:
- Retrieve logs efficiently, ensuring they fall within the requested 10-minute interval.
- Handle scenarios where logs wrap around due to the circular nature of the memory.
- Handle missing or invalid timestamps and account for possible gaps in the data.
- Return an error if the logs for the requested interval are no longer available in memory.

The process must be efficient, considering the constraints of the 600-second communication pass and the time cost of API calls.

---

### Approach

1. **Determine the Time of Interest**:
   - Calculate the memory addresses corresponding to the requested 10-minute interval using the `time_of_interest` and its duration.

2. **Fetch the Write Pointer (WP)**:
   - Use `get_wp()` to identify the current memory position (WP). 
   This determines whether the logs for the requested time interval are still available or have been overwritten.

3. **Handle Circular Buffer**:
   - Calculate the `start_address` and `end_address` for the logs based on the time of interest.
   - If the interval spans the end and beginning of the memory (wraparound), split the read operation into two parts.

4. **Efficient Log Retrieval**:
   - Use `read_log()` to fetch the logs in one or two API calls, minimizing the data read to save time.

5. **Validate Retrieved Logs**:
   - Check the timestamps of the logs to filter out invalid or corrupted entries.
   - Ensure the logs cover the entire requested interval. If gaps exist due to missing or overwritten data, return an error.

6. **Return Result**:
   - If the logs are valid and cover the requested time interval, return them.
   - If not, return an error indicating the data is unavailable.
